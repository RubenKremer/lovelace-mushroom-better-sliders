## What is mushroom-better-sliders?
This is a fork of the fantastic [Mushrooms UI Cards][original-repo] by piitaya, a collection of cards for [Home Assistant][home-assistant] Dashboard UI.

> :warning: **This mod will not work, if you still have the original Mushroom installed**

It focuses on making the sliders more touch friendly.

1. Sliders move on reduced speed when dragged by a finger (easier to hit small values)
2. Sliders can be dragged from any point on the slider (like in iOS Home)
3. Sliders apply live changes to your devices (except turning them off)
2. Explicitly makes it easier to hit 1%

The original lovelace-mushroom has to be disabled for it to work.
